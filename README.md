Day 1 - 7/6/21

I am new to machine learning and deep learning, but I have always been fascinated by how the human brain works and how our understanding of neuroscience
can be translated into something that a machine can use to intelligently interact with us. In addition to gaining insight into machine learning, I hope to 
use the program to network with people who share similar interests and get a taste of what machine learning is like. I also hope to gain proficiency in 
the common deep learning libraries available today, such as TensorFlow. 

Day 3 - 7/8/21

1) Supervised learning means we are giving the program a known dataset and then the program is trained based with new data and matched to the known target data set. 
Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, doesn't involve any target data. It is simply given some random data and it must then go through and find the pattens/relationships.

2) SciKit learn is focused more on machine learning and data modeling as opposed to data visualization and data analysis.
