Day 1 - 7/6/21

I am new to machine learning and deep learning, but I have always been fascinated by how the human brain works and how our understanding of neuroscience
can be translated into something that a machine can use to intelligently interact with us. In addition to gaining insight into machine learning, I hope to 
use the program to network with people who share similar interests and get a taste of what machine learning is like. I also hope to gain proficiency in 
the common deep learning libraries available today, such as TensorFlow.
