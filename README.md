Day 1 - 7/6/21

I am new to machine learning and deep learning, but I have always been fascinated by how the human brain works and how our understanding of neuroscience
can be translated into something that a machine can use to intelligently interact with us. In addition to gaining insight into machine learning, I hope to 
use the program to network with people who share similar interests and get a taste of what machine learning is like. I also hope to gain proficiency in 
the common deep learning libraries available today, such as TensorFlow.

1. Supervised learning means we are giving the program a known dataset and then the program is trained based with new data and matched to the known target data set. 
Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, doesn't involve any target data. It is simply given some random data and it must then go through and find the pattens/relationships.

2. SciKit learn is focused more on machine learning and data modeling as opposed to data visualization and data analysis.

In the midst of the current pandemic, oftentimes, we need to quickly and efficiently diagnose someone with COVID-19 so that we can provide proper isolation 
and prevent the spread of the virus to other healthy individuals. The following dataset offers CT and X-Ray images of both COVID and non-COVID patients.

Using suprevised machine learning, we can train a program via a classification algorithm so that it can quickly and accurately distinguish between patients with 
COVID-19 and those without COVID-19. This will not provide clinicians with a quick means of evaluating someone for COVID, but can also be used as a screening tool
to help alleviate some of the manual labor in analysing medical images. 

Day 7 - 7/12

1. Tensors are arrays that stores data in multidimensional space. They are used to store and organize data in machine learning. 
2. Unfortunately, due to compatibility issues, I was unable to run the TensorFlow part of the tutorial.
